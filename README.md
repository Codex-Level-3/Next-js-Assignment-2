# React State Management

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to deepen your understanding of state management in React using the useState hook. You will build two components: a counter that can increase, decrease, and reset its value, and a form that captures user input in a controlled manner. This exercise will reinforce the concepts of stateful logic in functional components and demonstrate the power of React's reactivity system.

## Project Overview

This project includes the following components:

### Counter Component

- Counter.jsx : Implemented a counter with buttons to increase, decrease, and reset its value.

### User Form Component

- UserForm.jsx : A form with a single text input for the user's name and a submit button. It implemented controlled component logic using the `useState` hook to manage input field state. An Alert displays the input value upon form submission.

### Results
